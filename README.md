# Projects
Unfinished projects used/created while learning mostly.
I began this journy near the end of 2023. There was a time when I was fairly proficient at manually editing SQL databases. 

I mostly learn in/from games,and I try to investigate things without crossing into "reverse engineering."

This will be a work in progess as I'm getting situated IRL.
